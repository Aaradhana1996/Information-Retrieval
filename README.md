# Information-Retrieval

This was a project in which we read in all the Wikipedia pages of all the US presidents.
We had to answer queries with the name(s) of the presidents which the query related to.
We used skip bigrams and the BM25 algorithm for this project. 

For more information on how the program was implemented, look at the 
"Information Retreival Analysis.pdf" file in this project.
